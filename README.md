# Booklist

This is a simple project to demonstrate use of GraphQL. 

It is the example project described in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

I have extended the app by adding option to add author and delete books.

Also I have used React+Typescript in the client app.


## Tech-Stack used:
- GraphQL
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- React.js
- Typescript


## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to server folder and add your mongo DB instance url in the config.js file.

You can get a free mongoDB instance from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

## Install dependencies

In server folder you can run **npm install** to install all dependencies.

In client folder you can run **yarn** or **npm install**

## Run the project

### Server
If you don't have already, install nodemon globally by running this command

**npm install -g nodemon**

Then in server folder, run **nodemon app**

It will run the server at port 4000

### Client

From another terminal window, in client folder, run **yarn start** or **npm start**

This will run the client app at port 3000

Now the app is accessible at http://localhost:3000/
